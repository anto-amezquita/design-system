## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- Add `AlertDialog` — a confirmation gate for actions the user must explicitly accept or decline, distinct from `Dialog`: real `alertdialog` role, no outside-click dismiss, no free-floating close button, forces a Cancel/Action choice. Built on `@radix-ui/react-alert-dialog` (new dependency); reuses `Dialog`'s own CSS classes and tokens rather than duplicating them, since visually it's the same box with a different behavioral contract underneath.

  Also extends `Dialog` with an optional `triggerRef` prop, merged with its existing internal one — lets a consumer keep a handle on the trigger element to restore focus there manually after a separate follow-up `AlertDialog` closes (a cross-dialog focus-restore case `Dialog`'s own internal focus-restore hook doesn't cover, since it only knows about itself). Non-breaking addition.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 3216252: `tokens/token-reference.json` now resolves every global primitive, not
  just the `color.*` group — 83 previously-invisible primitives
  (spacing, type scale, radii, motion, shadows, sizes, `feedback.*`
  colours) are now included. Total goes from 537 to 620 tokens (101
  primitive, 114 semantic, 405 component).

  **Breaking, within this field:** `meta.tokenCount` is renamed to
  `meta.total`, and now sits alongside `meta.primitiveCount`,
  `meta.semanticCount`, and `meta.componentCount`. Any consumer reading
  `tokenReference.meta.tokenCount` directly needs to switch to
  `meta.total`.

  `tokens/component-registry.json` gains an `internal` flag per
  component (set on components that ship in the package because
  something else imports them, but aren't meant to be used directly —
  currently just `BaseSheet`) and a `meta.publicComponentCount` field
  alongside the existing `meta.componentCount`.

  No changes to component source, styles, or hooks — this release only
  touches the two generated token/registry JSON files.

## 0.1.4

### Patch Changes

- 531f6bd: Ship the token artifacts with the package.

  `tokens/` is now included in `files`, so consumers and coding agents get the DTCG token source (`$value` / `$type`), the resolved token reference, and the component registry on install — previously these existed only in the repo and reached nobody who installed the package.

  First step of the AI-readiness roadmap (`docs/ai-readiness-plan.md`, Task 1.0).
